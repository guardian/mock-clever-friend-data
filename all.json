Blair, who mounted an unsuccessful campaign for president of the European council in 2009, said he didn't wish to take a leading role in the campaign for fear his intervention would be counter-productive.

In February, Lord Powell, one of her closest advisers, claimed she would have voted to remain in the EU under the conditions of the newly negotiated deal. A few days later, Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic Conservative MP, released a note written by Thatcher in 1993, saying she would not have signed up to the Maastricht Treaty, which established the EU under its current name. Cash said it was â€œinconceivableâ€ she wouldn't have wanted to leave.",

Cameron said in a speech that Churchill was never one to be an isolationist with regard to Europe. That same day, Johnson said Churchill had wanted Britain to play no part in the European project post-war. There are hints each way in Churchill's speeches and policies, but the balance of the evidence suggests he'd perhaps lean toward remaining.\n\n",
