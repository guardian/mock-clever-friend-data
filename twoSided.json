        "content2": "The Norwegian model would see Britain leave the EU but apply to become a member of the EEA, which allows full access to the EU's internal market, so it can trade most goods without customs fees. This option would cost less than being a full EU member, though not as much as EU-critics always suggest. Immigration is often mentioned with the Norwegian model, but it's irrelevant, as Norway is part of the Schengen border-free area and has higher per capita immigration than the EU.",

        "content3": "In return for access to the EEA market, Norway has to implement all the EU's law relating to the internal market â€“ about three-quarters of all EU legislation â€“ but cannot make decisions about how EU rules are drafted. The amount of money the UK would save is also relatively small  â€“  Britain would pay 94% of annual costs if it left the EU and remained in the EEA, estimates think tank Open Europe. In addition, it is argued that Norway, a small, oil-rich nation, is in a different economic position from the UK.",
